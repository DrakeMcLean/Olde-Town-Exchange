    Olde Town Exchange was opened in the Fall of 2015 by <u>Nadine Wolfe</u> &amp; <u>Nancy Felix McLean</u>.  As our children transitioned from high school, we found ourselves watching way too much HGTV (and maybe drinking a little too much wine) and the question soon became; <i>&quot;now what are we going to do?&quot;</i>

  We started throwing around some business ideas; something that we could do ourselves.  After working through several scenarios, we came upon the idea of a women's consignment store.  This idea stuck, all aspects of running a retail store seemed doable, and a business plan emerged.

  <br><br>
  What evolved was an Upscale Consignment Boutique for women.  A place where women could go and shop for on-trend, quality clothing and accessories in a place that was friendly and welcoming.  Our store would have fabulous pricing, inventory in excellent condition and a store easy to shop.

  <br><br>
  We are so very grateful to our committed team and to our old &amp; new friends who helped launch Olde Town Exchange and who continue to strengthen our business every day.
